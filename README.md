## Introduction
This repository compiles basic Python and R resources to build plots comparing distributions between one continous variable (e.g. protein production) across multiple discrete variables (e.g. samples). This situation is common due to the need to conduct replicates of experiments with multiple positive and negative controls.

## Getting Started
The files within this repository can be downloaded using the green "clone or download" button above.  
Inside this repository contains:
  - Cheatsheet PDFs for quick viewing
  - Associated notebooks and raw data to generate plots within cheatsheets

Within the notebooks provided, the system and session info are detailed.
